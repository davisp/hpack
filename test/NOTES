Resize to bigger does not evict elements
Resizing evicts for each:
    0 elements
    1 element
    more than one element
    all elements

Reuse the index entry of a static defined name/value header

Ensure we use static index entries for name_indexed instead of a value in the
    dynamic table

Adding an index entry can evict:
    Zero entries
    One entry
    More than one entry
    All entries
    All entries resulting in an empty table
