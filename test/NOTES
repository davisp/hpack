Test decision on compression short strings? I.e., should we ship ship strings
smaller than a few bytes without huffman encoding?

Does dynamic size change need to precede all headers?


Test invalid packet returns rest of the binary

Encode dynamic index 63 in a single byte

Resize to bigger does not evict elements
Resizing evicts for each:
    0 elements
    1 element
    more than one element
    all elements

Reuse the index entry of a static defined name/value header

Ensure we use static index entries for name_indexed instead of a value in the
    dynamic table

Adding an index entry can evict:
    Zero entries
    One entry
    More than one entry
    All entries
    All entries resulting in an empty table


Huffman encoding includes EOS
Huffman encoding doesn't end on prefix of EOS
